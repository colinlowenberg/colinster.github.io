		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I graduated from the University of Texas in Austin where I studied Electrical & Computer Engineering 
				while working at Broadcom testing 802.11 WLAN hardware and software. <br><br>
				I consulted Fortune 500 companies as the Chief Wireless Architect at Accenture designing and deploying networks for oil refineries, casinos, museums, warehouses, offices, and even buses. <br><br>
				I joined Cisco's wireless product management team and launched the Cisco Meraki APIs as a Platform for developers while building a technology partner program and app 
				marketplace. <br><br>
				Switching gears on my career, I left Cisco to build a developer community for an Ethereum-like blockchain. I scaled a business providing therapy dogs to people in need, Dogtime Community, to deliver over 2,000 sessions - with the 
				help of over 5,000 dog owners around the world. <br><br>
				During COVID-19, I put a paws on the dog business and focused on Bluetooth contact tracing technology with 
				Coalition App and then joined Sumo Logic (just in time for the IPO) as the first
				technical product marketing manager focused on go to market for developer products. 
				<br><br>Today, I spend my 
				time investing, roller-skating, and looking for my next big project.</p>
