			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I graduated from University of Texas in Austin where I studied Electrical & Computer Engineering 
				and learned the ins and outs of 802.11 protocols, hardware, drivers, working as a field 
				applications engineer for Broadcom. <br><br>
				After school, I worked in consulting at Accenture for 7 years where I became the Chief Wireless 
				Architect a designed and deployed WiFi for museums, casinos, warehouses, offices, transit systems,
				 and oil refineries. <br><br>
				I joined Cisco's product management team to work on WiFi, but I ended up focusing on APIs and 
				launching the Cisco Meraki Platform for developers and building a technology partner app 
				marketplace. <br><br>
				I started a business providing therapy dogs to people in need, Dogtime Community, 
				and eventually left Cisco to focus on scaling the buisness to support over 2,000 events with the 
				help of over 5,000 dog owners around the world. <br><br>
				During COVID-19, I put a paws on the dog business and focused on contact tracing technology with 
				Coalition App and joined Sumo Logic (just in time for the IPO) as the first
				technical product marketing manager focused on go to market for developer products. 
				<br><br>Now I spend my 
				time investing in cryptocurrencies, roller-skating, and building companies.</p>
